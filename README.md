# CE Final Work

## Background
In the lab, tools left on the table are often borrowed or moved while Iâ€™m away for soldering or 3D printing. This results in frequent searches across the lab to locate my tools. To address this issue, I designed a tool that acts as an assistant to monitor my equipment and notify me when items are moved or returned.

## Aim
This project aims to create a portable lighting control system, designed in the shape of a gas lamp, using a photoresistor and an ultrasonic distance sensor. 

### Features:
- **Distance-based lighting**: The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance between the lamp and nearby objects.  
  - Within 20 cm: LEDs light up red.  
  - Beyond 20 cm: The color transitions from red to blue as the distance increases.  
- **Idle behavior**: When no object is detected, the LEDs progressively turn off at a rate of one LED per second. Upon detecting an object, all LEDs light up again.  
- **Photoresistor as a switch**: The photoresistor mimics the behavior of an oil lamp. Covering it turns off the LEDs, and uncovering it lights up the lamp.  

## Circuit and Software Design
This project builds upon hardware and software design concepts from the UCL CE coursework. All related code is stored in the `CE` folder. Below is a breakdown of the files and their purposes:

### Code Versions:
- **`sketch_cefinal3`**: Final version with full functionality.  
- **`sketch_cefinal1-1.2`**: Debugging the ultrasonic distance sensor, photoresistor, and MQTT publishing.  
- **`sketch_cefinal2-2.3`**: Testing the ring buffer and threshold filtering to remove noise.  
- **`sketch_ultrasonic_ranging`**: Ultrasonic ranging functionality.  
- **`sketch_contalled`**: MQTT connection and publishing.  
- **`sketch-firstcalss`**: Photoresistor input mapping and calibration.

### Circuit Design:
The circuit follows concepts from the UCL CASA0016 coursework [(1)] and includes:
- Ultrasonic distance measurements using the formula [(2)]:

  ```cpp
  long duration = pulseIn(ECHO_PIN, HIGH);
  float distance = (duration * 0.034) / 2.0;
